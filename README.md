Their is also a recent news section or posts from the website host. A user can use their own email to signup or use Gihub socail platform to sign into the app.
The Admin can create, read, update and delete posts and Beers and Breweries in the django administration section. 
The pages are designed to be responsive with a masonary feel on the items and news post sections. A customer can easily see their added quantities in the shopping bag and checkout their items for delivery.

# Notice of Image Use:
I do not own any of the photographs however I have been given express permission to use any photographs from the breweries shown directly. I operate Craft beer tasting sessions under [DublinBeerTasting](www.dublinbeertasting.com) and as such have a good working relationship with all showcased breweries.
